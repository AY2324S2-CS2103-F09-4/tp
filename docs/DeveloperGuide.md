### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/HealthSync-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/HealthSync-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/HealthSync-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/HealthSync-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/HealthSync-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/HealthSync-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `HealthSyncParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `HealthSyncParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `HealthSyncParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/HealthSync-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* Please note all entity objects in the `Model` component are immutable.
* * stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

The `Person` entity,
* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

The `Note` entity,
* each person has a list of `Note` objects which are stored in a `ObservableList`.
* when rebuilding a `Person` object, the `Note` objects can be copied over from the old `Person` object to the new one. Since all objects are immutable, this should not pose any issues.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `HealthSync`, which `Person` references. This allows `HealthSync` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/HealthSync-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `HealthSyncStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.HealthSync.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo feature (Patient medical record commands for now)

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo mechanism is facilitated by `LogicManager` acting as the command invoker within the command pattern.
It implements the interface `CommandHistory` to manage a command history stack containing a set of `UndoableCommand` to support the *undo feature*.
Below are the implemented `CommandHistory` operations:

* `LogicManager#addCommand(UndoableCommand )`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds an `UndoableCommand` to the history stack *(more of deque data structure in the actual implementation)*.
The stack keeps track of at most 10 most recent actions.
* `LogicManager#undoLastCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Pops the most recent `UndoableCommand` from the history and restores the previous `AddressBook` state tracked by the `UndoableCommand` object that was popped.

Below is an example scenario on how the undo works with the command history stack maintained by the `LogicManager`

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `LogicManager` will be initialized with an empty command history stack.

![UndoState0](images/UndoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 1` command to delete the 1st patient medical record from the address book.
The `DeleteCommand` extends `UndoableCommand` and thus supports undoable behaviours.
The `DeleteCommand#execute()` is called and saves the current `AddressBook` state as the previous state before modifying it to carry out the delete command.
After executing `DeleteCommand` the command object itself will be pushed into the command history managed by the `LogicManager`.

![UndoState1](images/UndoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add nric/S9974837D n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new patient medical record.
The `AddCommand` command also calls `AddCommand#execute()`, similar to the delete command, it saves the current `AddressBook` as the previous state before carrying out the add command.

![UndoState2](images/UndoState2.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
    :information_source: **Note:**
    If a command fails it won't continue execution and error handlers will handle the respective `CommandException` thrown.
    The command would not be pushed into the history stack.
</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `LogicManager#undoLastCommand`, and this would pop the most recent `UndoableCommand` as explained above.
Once the `UndoableCommand` was popped the `UndoableCommand#undo()` is executed which reverts the `AddressBook` into the previous state saved within the command.

![UndoState3](images/UndoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
    :information_source: **Note:**
    If the command history stack is empty then there is nothing to undo and the message "No commands left to undo." is returned as output to the user.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagramLogic](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`.
Commands like `ListCommand` that does not modify the address book does not extend `UndoableCommand` and would execute `ListCommand#execute()` without saving prev state for undo feature.
Thus, the `LogicManager` command history remains unchanged.

![UndoState4](images/UndoState4.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
    :information_source: **Note:**
    Once the command history stack contains 10 items, when a new `UndoableCommand` is executed least recent command *(bottom of the stack)* is removed
    and push the new one on the top.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Current choice:** Saves the entire address book as prev state in each undoable command.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo by
  itself. Instead of saving the whole address book within each command as prev state, only the change itself is saved.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Find feature (Draft)

#### Proposed Implementation
The `FindCommand` feature allows user to search for patients in the patient book efficiently. It is implemented using a `Predicate<Person>` to filer out the patient book.

The parsing of user input is handled by `FindCommandParser`. This parser constructs all the relevant predicates based on the prefixes and keywords given by the user. It then combines the predicates which is used to construct `FindCommand`.

#### Design considerations:

##### Predicate Implementation
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement predicates as separate classes (e.g. name, gender, nric, etc.)
  * Pros: Better code readability as its own filtering logic is encapsulated in its own class.
  * Cons: Increases the number of classes, some duplication of similar logic code.

* **Alternative 2:** Combining predicate logic in a single class.
  * Pros: Reduces the number of classes.
  * Cons: Reduced readability and maintainability with mixed predicate test logic.
